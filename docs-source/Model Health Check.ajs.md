The Model Health Check script is a powerful tool for analyzing and improving your ArchiMate models in Archi. This tutorial will guide you through using the script and interpreting its results.

## Prerequisites

- Archi with the JArchi plugin installed
- An ArchiMate model to analyze

## Running the Script

1. Open your ArchiMate model in Archi.
2. In the Archi menu, go to `Scripts > JArchi Scripts Menu`.
3. In the JArchi Scripts Menu, find and select "Model Health Check" under the "Analysis" category.
4. Click "Execute" to run the script.

## Understanding the Results

The Model Health Check dialog presents its findings in four tabs:

### 1. Summary Tab

This tab provides an overview of your model's composition:

- Total Elements
- Total Relationships
- Total Views
- Number of Unused Elements
- Elements Missing Documentation
- Breakdown of Element Types

Review these numbers to get a quick sense of your model's size and completeness.

### 2. Unused Elements Tab

This tab lists all elements that are not used in any view. Consider whether these elements are necessary or if they can be removed to streamline your model.

### 3. View Complexity Tab

This tab shows the complexity of each view in your model:

- View Name
- Number of Elements
- Number of Relationships
- Complexity Score (sum of elements and relationships)

The Complexity Score is color-coded:
- Green: Low complexity (30 or fewer)
- Orange: Medium complexity (31-50)
- Red: High complexity (over 50)

Consider breaking down views with high complexity scores into multiple, more focused views.

### 4. Recommendations Tab

This tab provides general recommendations for improving your model, such as:

- Cleaning up unused elements
- Adding missing documentation
- Breaking down complex views
- Ensuring proper relationships
- Validating element connections

## Acting on the Results

1. **Unused Elements**: Review the list and decide whether to:
   - Delete truly unused elements
   - Incorporate overlooked elements into appropriate views

2. **Missing Documentation**: Systematically add documentation to elements that lack it, prioritizing key components of your architecture.

3. **View Complexity**: For views with high complexity scores:
   - Consider creating sub-views or alternate views that focus on specific aspects
   - Review if all elements in the view are necessary

4. **Element Type Balance**: Check if the distribution of element types aligns with your modeling goals and ArchiMate best practices.

5. **General Recommendations**: Work through the list of recommendations, addressing each point to improve your model's overall quality and clarity.

## Best Practices

- Run the Model Health Check regularly, especially before major reviews or after significant changes to your model.
- Use the script's findings as a guide, but always apply your domain knowledge and modeling expertise when making changes.
- Consider setting internal standards for view complexity and documentation completeness based on the script's metrics.

By consistently using the Model Health Check script and acting on its recommendations, you can maintain a high-quality, well-structured ArchiMate model that effectively communicates your architecture.
