The "Generate Meta Model from View" script is a powerful tool for ArchiMate modelers using Archi with jArchi scripts. It analyzes a selected ArchiMate view and generates a meta model in JSON schema format, capturing the structure and relationships of the elements in your view.

## Features

- Analyzes the currently selected ArchiMate view
- Generates a JSON schema representing the meta model
- Excludes non-standard ArchiMate elements for a focused meta model
- Ensures unique entries for element types and relationships
- Saves the generated meta model as a JSON file

## Prerequisites

- Archi with jArchi scripts installed
- Basic understanding of ArchiMate modeling
- Familiarity with JSON schema structure (for interpreting the output)

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare Your ArchiMate View**
   - Open your ArchiMate model in Archi
   - Create or select the view you want to generate a meta model from
   - Ensure your view contains the elements and relationships you want to include in the meta model

2. **Run the Script**
   - In Archi, select the view you want to analyze
   - Open the jArchi Scripts menu
   - Locate and click on "Generate Meta Model from View"

3. **Save the Meta Model**
   - After the script runs, a file dialog will appear
   - Choose a location on your computer to save the JSON file
   - Give the file a meaningful name (e.g., "MyProjectMetaModel.json")
   - Click "Save"

4. **Review the Generated Meta Model**
   - Open the saved JSON file in a text editor or JSON viewer
   - The meta model will have two main sections:
     - `nodes`: Lists all unique ArchiMate element types found in the view
     - `relationships`: Lists all unique relationships between element types

5. **Interpret the Meta Model**
   - The `nodes` section shows all element types used in your view
   - The `relationships` section shows allowed connections between elements
   - Each relationship entry specifies:
     - `type`: The type of relationship
     - `source`: The type of element where the relationship starts
     - `target`: The type of element where the relationship ends

## Example Output

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "nodes": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "id": { "type": "string" },
          "type": { 
            "enum": ["business-actor", "business-role", "business-process"]
          },
          "name": { "type": "string" },
          "description": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["id", "type", "name", "description"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    },
    "relationships": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "type": { "type": "string" },
          "source": { "type": "string" },
          "target": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["type", "source", "target"],
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "anyOf": [
          {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["assignment-relationship"] },
              "source": { "enum": ["business-actor"] },
              "target": { "enum": ["business-role"] }
            },
            "required": ["type", "source", "target"],
            "additionalProperties": false
          },
          {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["triggering-relationship"] },
              "source": { "enum": ["business-process"] },
              "target": { "enum": ["business-process"] }
            },
            "required": ["type", "source", "target"],
            "additionalProperties": false
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["nodes", "relationships"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Model Validation**: Use the meta model to validate other ArchiMate models for consistency.
2. **Documentation**: Generate documentation about the structure of your ArchiMate models.
3. **Analysis**: Analyze the complexity and structure of your architecture models.
4. **Tool Integration**: Use the meta model to integrate ArchiMate data with other tools or scripts.

## Troubleshooting

- If the script doesn't run, ensure you have a view selected in Archi.
- If the meta model is empty, check if your view contains standard ArchiMate elements and relationships.
- For any errors, check the console output for error messages and details.

## Conclusion

The "Generate Meta Model from View" script provides a quick and easy way to extract the underlying structure of your ArchiMate models. By generating a JSON schema representation, it opens up possibilities for further analysis, validation, and integration of your architectural models.
